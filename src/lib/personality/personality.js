      overarching principle underlying what they observe. They seek to
      comprehend life's underlying themes in all of their complexity.`,
  desc2: ` INTPs are detached, analytical observers who, because they are so
      engrossed in their thoughts, can appear to be unaware of their
      surroundings. They spend a lot of time thinking internally, exploring
      ideas, connecting dots, and trying to understand how things work. The
      Architect views life as an ongoing investigation into the complexities of
      the cosmos.`,
  standsfor1: `The INTP personality type is defined by a person's need for solitude (introverted),
      focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), use
      of logic and reason in decision-making (thinking), and preference for spontaneity
      and flexibility over planned and organised activities.`,
  values1: `Although they have a cold demeanour, INTPs are deeply passionate about
        logic, research, and invention. In order to integrate the concepts they

        understanding. They will go to tremendous mental lengths in an effort to
        come up with original answers to intriguing challenges since their
        thoughts are sophisticated and busy.`,
  values2: ` The INTP tends to be unconventional and is less likely to follow the majority
        in favour of developing their own unique method of doing things. The INTP
        is wary of traditions and assumptions and is willing to dissect concepts
        that other people take for granted. INTPs hold little holy and are ruthless
        in their analysis of ideas and beliefs. Other people who adhere to ideologies
        that defy reason frequently leave them perplexed.`,

  see1: `INTPs frequently seem eccentric and odd to others because they are so
        deeply absorbed in their own thinking. The INTP has a very active
        intellect, and because of their tendency to focus inward, they may
        overlook little matters like home furnishings or acceptable attire.
        Instead than engaging in small talk, they can get fervent when
        discussing subjects like physics, math, computers, or more grandiose
        cosmic theoretical conundrums. The Architect is frequently more
        interested in the theory underlying everything than in reality.`,
  see2: `INTPs often speak clearly and choose their words carefully to convey
        complicated topics. Even in the most informal of talks, they insist on
        intellectual rigour, and they are quick to point out errors in logic or
        ideas. An INTP who is more engaged in examining logic may disregard
        social graces, and they may insult others by subjecting their deeply
        held values and beliefs to logical analysis.`,

    type ESTP is characterised by extraversion (being energised by other
    people), sensing (focusing on facts and details rather than ideas
    and concepts), thinking (making decisions based on logic and
    reason), and preference for spontaneity and flexibility over planned
    and organised behaviour (Perceiving). Because of their high-energy,
    active way of life, ESTPs are also known as "dynamo personalities."`,
  values1: ` Natural athletes, ESTPs can move around their physical environment
    with ease and have a good sense of coordination. They frequently
    love putting their skills to the test in risky or even dangerous
    activities, and they enjoy using this physical aptitude in the
    search of thrill and adventure.`,
  values2: `The moment-to-moment focus of the ESTP is action. They interact with
    their surroundings and find quick solutions to difficulties of a practical
    nature. ESTPs succeed in urgent situations when they can use their logical
    thinking to determine the best course of action. The ESTP loves to see
    immediate, observable results, therefore long-term goals are less intriguing
    to them.`,

  see1: `The ESTP's energy is probably what you notice about them right away.
    They frequently converse, joke around, and flirt with both friends
    and total strangers. They enjoy having lively interactions with
    others and making everyone around them laugh with their silly
    humour. People are frequently kept on their toes since they never
    know what the ESTP will make fun of next. ESTPs are openly sociable
    with others, but their interest in people may wane over time. They
    are more likely to work a room and have a good time with everyone
    than they are to have a meaningful conversation with any one person.`,
  see2: `ESTPs feel at ease in their surroundings and are constantly looking for
    something to do. They are the most naturally coordinated of all the types
    and are frequently seen participating in sports or other physical activities,
    particularly ones that include some level of danger. They fit the stereotype
    of "adrenaline junkies" and can be seen participating in extreme sports
    like skydiving or racing motorcycles.`,
  famous: `Famous ESTPs include Evel Knievel, Donald Trump, George W. Bush, Mae
    West, Eddie Murphy, Miley Cyrus, Bruce Willis, and Winston
    Churchill.`,
  hobbies: `Sports and athletic activities of all kinds, especially team sports
    and dangerous or daring endeavours like racing, boxing, or flying,
    are popular pastimes for an ESTP.`,
