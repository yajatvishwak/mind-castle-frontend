  desc1: `Philosophical innovators, INTPs are enthralled by logical reasoning,
      systems, and aesthetics. They are theoretically obsessed and look for an
      overarching principle underlying what they observe. They seek to
      comprehend life's underlying themes in all of their complexity.`,
  desc2: ` INTPs are detached, analytical observers who, because they are so
      engrossed in their thoughts, can appear to be unaware of their
      surroundings. They spend a lot of time thinking internally, exploring
      ideas, connecting dots, and trying to understand how things work. The
      Architect views life as an ongoing investigation into the complexities of
      the cosmos.`,
  standsfor1: `The INTP personality type is defined by a person's need for solitude (introverted),
      focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), use
      of logic and reason in decision-making (thinking), and preference for spontaneity
      and flexibility over planned and organised activities.`,
  values1: `Although they have a cold demeanour, INTPs are deeply passionate about
        logic, research, and invention. In order to integrate the concepts they
        have noticed in their settings, they try to build intricate systems of
        understanding. They will go to tremendous mental lengths in an effort to
        come up with original answers to intriguing challenges since their
        thoughts are sophisticated and busy.`,
  values2: ` The INTP tends to be unconventional and is less likely to follow the majority
        in favour of developing their own unique method of doing things. The INTP
        is wary of traditions and assumptions and is willing to dissect concepts
        that other people take for granted. INTPs hold little holy and are ruthless
        in their analysis of ideas and beliefs. Other people who adhere to ideologies
        that defy reason frequently leave them perplexed.`,

  see1: `INTPs frequently seem eccentric and odd to others because they are so
        deeply absorbed in their own thinking. The INTP has a very active
        intellect, and because of their tendency to focus inward, they may
        overlook little matters like home furnishings or acceptable attire.
        Instead than engaging in small talk, they can get fervent when
        discussing subjects like physics, math, computers, or more grandiose
        cosmic theoretical conundrums. The Architect is frequently more
        interested in the theory underlying everything than in reality.`,
  see2: `INTPs often speak clearly and choose their words carefully to convey
        complicated topics. Even in the most informal of talks, they insist on
        intellectual rigour, and they are quick to point out errors in logic or
        ideas. An INTP who is more engaged in examining logic may disregard
        social graces, and they may insult others by subjecting their deeply
        held values and beliefs to logical analysis.`,
  famous: `Famous INTPs include Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Kristen Stewart,
        Rene Descartes, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Socrates, and Abraham
        Lincoln.`,

  desc1: `Idealistic planners, ENFJs are determined to carry out their vision
    of what is best for humanity. Because of their capacity for
    recognising potential in others and their charismatic ability to
    influence others, they frequently serve as catalysts for human
    growth. They are fervent about the possibilities for people and are
    values- and vision-driven.`,
  desc2: ` ENFJs frequently have a lot on their plates and tend to be enthusiastic
  and driven people. They have a keen awareness of others' needs and are
  sensitive to human suffering, but they also have a tendency to be upbeat
  and forward-looking, instinctively sensing opportunities for progress.
  While the ENFJ is ambitious, it is not self-serving; rather, they feel
  personally accountable for improving the world.`,
  standsfor1: `One of the sixteen personality types developed by Isabel Myers and
  Katharine Briggs is referred to by the acronym ENFJ. Extraverted,
  iNtuitive, Feeling, and Judging are its initials. Extroverted,
  iNtuitive, feeling, and extraverted are all characteristics of the
  ENFJ personality type. They focus on ideas and concepts rather than
  facts and details, make decisions based on their values and
  feelings, and prefer to be organised and planned rather than
  spontaneous and flexible. Because of their desire to foster the
  growth and development of others, ENFJs are sometimes referred to as
  teacher personalities.`,
  values1: `ENFJs are motivated by a strong sense of empathy and altruism. They
  frequently serve as an emotional barometer for others around them
  since they have an intuitive awareness of others' emotions. Their
  compassion, however, is not limited to those close to them; they
  frequently have a humanitarian outlook and may genuinely care about
  the woes of the entire human race. They often feel other people's
  emotions firsthand and are moved to action when they witness
  suffering.`,
  values2: `ENFJs value intimate relationships and mutual support and think that
  working together is the best approach to accomplish goals. They seek
  approval and are extremely sensitive to both positive and negative criticism.
  The ENFJ may be frustrated when others are not as sincere in their goals
  as they are since they want the best not only from themselves but also
  from others. ENFJs put up a lot of effort to keep their bonds strong
  and to contribute positively to their families, groups, and communities.`,

  see1: `Natural educators, ENFJs are frequently seen getting others to
  participate in educational activities. They have a propensity to
  assume control and direct a group of people toward the experiences
  and activities that will best serve their learning and development.
  They have a keen sense of human potential, and they inspire others
  to develop their strengths further by being warm and charismatic.
  They are usually active and busy, and they frequently exhibit
  visible vigour when inspiring others to learn new things.`,
  see2: `ENFJs are often good communicators with a gift for connecting with others
  through language. They have a keen sense of interpersonal interactions
  and like discussing them. They frequently take pleasure in assisting
  others in resolving personal issues and love imparting their knowledge
  of people, their emotions, and their motivations. They can become worn
  out if there is too much negative emotion around because they can be
  overly sympathetic at times.`,
  famous: `Oprah Winfrey, Martin Luther King, Jr., Margaret Mead, Maya Angelou,
  Ralph Nader, Abraham Maslow, and Dr. Phil McGraw are notable ENFJs.`,
  hobbies: `The ENFJ enjoys planning social gatherings, reading, the arts,
  visiting museums, listening to music, writing, storytelling, and
  gourmet cooking.`,
