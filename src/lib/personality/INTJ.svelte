        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The INTJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            INTJs are analytical problem-solvers who are driven to innovate and
            enhance systems and procedures. They have a gift for identifying
            areas where they can grow—at work, at home, or even within
            themselves.
            <br />
            INTJs are frequently smart and appreciate deductive reasoning and difficult
            problems. They look at life through the lens of the theory that underlies
            what they observe and are often inwardly focused on their own thoughtful
            analysis of the world around them. INTJs are drawn to logical processes
            and considerably less at ease around other people's emotions and their
            propensity for unpredictability. They often choose to associate with
            those that they find intellectually challenging since they are autonomous
            and picky in their interactions.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does INTJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            INTJ is one of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel
            Myers and Katharine Briggs, the authors of the MBTI®. Introverted,
            iNtuitive, Thinking, and Judging, or INTJ, are four fundamental
            personality qualities based on the research of psychologist C.G.
            Jung.
            <br />
            Each of the four letters that make up the INTJ code stands for a crucial
            aspect of this personality type. Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, and
            focusing on ideas and concepts rather than facts and specifics are the
            characteristics of INTJs. They also tend to be planned and ordered rather
            than spontaneous and flexible (Judging).
            <br />
            Because of their methodical, strategic thinking style, INTJs are commonly
            referred to as mastermind types. The INTJ also goes by the names:
            <ul>
                <li>The Conceptual Planner (MBTI)</li>
                <li>The Architect (16Personalities)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">INTJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            INTJs are astute when it comes to systems and strategy, and they
            frequently view the world as a chessboard that must be manoeuvred.
            The INTJ frequently have a special capacity to predict logical
            consequences, which drives their desire to comprehend how systems
            function and how events unfold. They like giving a project or idea
            their whole attention and working hard to accomplish their
            objectives.
            <br />
            INTJs are frequently perfectionists with extremely high standards of
            performance for both themselves and other people. They have a thirst
            for information and work continually to improve their competence. They
            frequently have a strong interest in improving themselves and are lifelong
            learners who are constantly striving to expand their knowledge and awareness.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the INTJ</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            In general, INTJs are reserved, serious, and appear to think a lot.
            They frequently desire to discover the underlying principle of what
            they observe because they are curious about the world around them.
            They carefully review the information they are given, and if a
            question is posed, they will often give it thoughtful consideration
            before offering a sophisticated answer. INTJs are analytical and
            clear thinkers who frequently have a suggestion on how to complete a
            task more quickly. They have a tendency to be direct in their
            communication and frequently speak in terms of the overall approach,
            omitting the specifics.
            <br />
            Although INTJs aren't typically warm or outgoing, they do have a self-assured
            demeanour with others that stems from their confidence in their own brilliance.
            They discuss their concepts with assurance, and after they have come
            to a conclusion, they fully anticipate that others would agree that their
            insights are wise. They often strive for perfection and value a stimulating
            workplace. The Mastermind often has no qualms about pointing out when
            someone's opinions don't make logical sense, and because of this, they
            can find themselves into problems. They enjoy discussing interesting
            concepts.
