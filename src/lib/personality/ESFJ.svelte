        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ESFJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFJs are energetically committed to their duties, sensitive to the
            needs of others, and diligent helpers. They are extremely sensitive
            to their emotional surroundings and perceptive to other people's
            emotions as well as their own. ESFJs are eager to please and give,
            and they like an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation.
            <br />
            ESFJs typically put their family and friends first and respect tradition
            and devotion. They give freely of their time, energy, and feelings. They
            frequently treat other people's problems as if they were their own and
            will make an effort to use their strong organising skills to make other
            people's lives more orderly.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ESFJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is known by the acronym ESFJ. Extraverted, Sensing,
            Feeling, and Judging are its initials. A person with the personality
            type ESFJ is extraverted, sensing, feeling, and feeling. They
            prioritise facts and details above ideas and concepts, focus on
            facts and details rather than ideas and concepts, and like to be
            structured and planned rather than spontaneous and flexible
            (Judging). Because of their concern in providing for others in
            practical ways, ESFJs are frequently referred to as Provider
            personalities.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ESFJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFJs uphold a high moral standard and expect others to do the same.
            They frequently have a black-and-white, right-and-wrong perspective
            on life, and they are typically not afraid to criticise the actions
            of others. In order to achieve harmony and collaboration, ESFJs
            believe that everyone should abide by the same set of norms. They
            perceive a social order in how individuals interact with one
            another, and they frequently assume roles that allow them to
            contribute to enforcing that order.
            <br />
            ESFJs are typically willing to participate and offer assistance because
            they have a sense of personal responsibility for other people's needs.
            They are typically responsible and realistic, placing duty ahead of pleasure,
            especially when it comes to taking care of others. They frequently have
            a regular schedule and typically love regularity, which enables them
            to be well-organized and effective.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ESFJ</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFJs are frequently found serving as hosts or hostesses. They
            frequently volunteer to be the organiser and want to make sure that
            everyone is taken care of. The ESFJ is a good fit for positions like
            committee chair, event coordinator, and church volunteer. They often
            take an active role in their communities and put in a lot of effort
            to uphold the social order. ESFJs have a keen interest in other
            people and like learning about the specifics of their lives. Many
            ESFJs enjoy engaging in gossip; they enjoy telling tales about those
            around them.
            <br />
            ESFJs have a strong moral compass that directs their conduct and sets
            high standards for others. They frequently hold firm beliefs about how
            people ought to act and what is right. ESFJs frequently have a keen interest
            in manners and other social norms. They might have a strict sense of
            right and wrong, of black and white. Even though they have the best of
            intentions and merely want everyone to obey the rules so that they can
            all get along, they can be judgmental of others who they feel are not
            performing in an appropriate manner. The ESFJ may get overly preoccupied
            with other people's issues because they want everything to go smoothly
            for those around them.
