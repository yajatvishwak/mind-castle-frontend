        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ENTJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Strategic leaders driven to orchestrate change, ENTJs are. They
            appreciate creating long-term strategies to realise their vision
            since they are quick to spot inefficiency and envision fresh
            alternatives. They are typically articulate and perceptive, and they
            excel in logical reasoning.
            <br />
            ENTJs enjoy providing order to the world around them and are analytical
            and objective. The ENTJ can identify weaknesses in a system and enjoys
            the process of finding and implementing a more effective solution. ENTJs
            are assertive and like to be in charge; they see themselves as managers
            and leaders who coordinate people and processes to accomplish their objectives.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ENTJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is known by the initials ENTJ. Extraverted,
            iNtuitive, Thinking, and Judging are its initials. The personality
            type ENTJ describes someone who gets their energy from being around
            other people (Extraverted), who prefers ideas and concepts to facts
            and details (iNtuitive), who bases their decisions on logic and
            reason (Thinking), and who prefers to be organised and planned
            rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). Because of their
            intrinsic desire to lead others, ENTJs are sometimes referred to as
            Commander personalities.

        <div class="mt-4">
            ENTJs are frequently highly driven by professional accomplishment
            and take pleasure in working hard. They have aspirations of being
            influential and powerful. Making decisions is what they do for a
            living. They want to be able to make the decision and initiate
            action.
            <br />

            and can occasionally be harsh or critical in the process. They are often
            outgoing and sociable, yet they occasionally fail to recognise others'
            subtle emotional cues. They frequently like working with people to achieve
            a shared objective, but they might not have time to take care of their
            emotions. They are results-driven and aspire to be effective, knowledgeable,
            and influential.
