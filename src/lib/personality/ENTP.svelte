    <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ENTP Personality Type</h1>
    <div class="mt-4">
      ENTPs are inspired innovators who are driven to come up with fresh answers
      to complex issues. They are intelligent and inquisitive and try to
      understand the people, institutions, and ideologies around them.
      Visionaries are unconventional and open-minded people who want to
      understand, analyze, and influence others.
      <br />
      ENTPs like experimenting with concepts and especially appreciate engaging in
      conversation. They maintain the upper hand with others by making light of their
      quirks and habits while also using their quick wit and knowledge of language.
      Although the ENTP likes to test others, in the end they are usually content
      to let things go. Although they don't often pass judgment, they might be impatient
      with those who can't keep up.
    </div>

    <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ENTP stand for?</h1>
    <div class="mt-4">
      One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
      Katharine Briggs is known by the initials ENTP. Extraverted, iNtuitive,
      Thinking, and Perceiving are its initials. ENTP describes a person as
      being extraverted (energized by time spent with others), intuitive
      (focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details), thinking
      (makes decisions using logic and reason), and preferring to be flexible
      and impromptu rather than planned and organized. Because of their
      enthusiasm for original, cutting-edge concepts, ENTPs are occasionally
      referred to as visionary types.
    </div>

    <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ENTP Values and Motivations</h1>
    <div class="mt-4">
      ENTPs thrive on a challenge and are frequently motivated by issues that
      other people think are insurmountable. They may believe that others are
      too enmeshed in tradition to perceive a new perspective because they are
      self-assured in their capacity for original thought. The Visionary rarely
      feels the need for preparation because they rely on their ingenuity to
      deal with the world around them. They frequently enter a new situation
      headfirst and have faith in their ability to change as they go.
      <br />
      ENTPs excel at reinventing the wheel and frequently object to performing the
      same activity in the same way twice. They challenge conventions and frequently
      reject them entirely. The Visionary finds little inspiration in established
      practises and would much rather experiment with one (or two) novel approaches
      than follow the norm.
    </div>

    <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ENTP</h1>
    <div class="mt-4">
      The majority of ENTPs are amiable and frequently charming. They frequently
      strive to appear intelligent and may use their sharp wit and biting humour
      to wow others. They are interested in their surroundings and desire to
      understand how things work. The ENTP, on the other hand, believes that the
      laws of nature were designed to be defied. They enjoy looking for ways to
      take advantage of the system and identifying weaknesses. This is not to
      indicate that the Visionary is evil; rather, they simply find regulations
      to be restrictive and think there may be an undiscovered better, quicker,
      or more interesting method to accomplish tasks.
      <br />
      The ENTP exhibits typical entrepreneurial traits and could be fast to divulge
      a fresh business concept or creation. They are creative and self-assured, and
      they are frequently eager to share their many brilliant ideas. The ENTP's zeal
      for innovation is contagious, and they frequently succeed in persuading others
      to support their plans. But because they tend to think "big picture," they
      could have trouble remembering or describing specifics. They tend to be more
      enthusiastic about exploring an idea than about turning it into reality, and
      if they don't follow through with all of their many ideas, they might come
      off as unreliable.
