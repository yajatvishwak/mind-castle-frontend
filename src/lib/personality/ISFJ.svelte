        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ISFJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ISFJs are devoted upholders of customs and institutions who work
            hard. They are driven to provide for others and safeguard them from
            the dangers of life because they are realistic, sympathetic, and
            caring.
            <br />
            ISFJs appreciate contributing to society's established systems since
            they are practical and conventional. They have a strong sense of obligation
            to others and are dependable, committed workers. Particularly while attending
            to others' needs, they concentrate on performing their duty. They want
            other people to recognise their dependability and ability to fulfil obligations.
            They work diligently and methodically and don't give up until the project
            is finished.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ISFJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types developed by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is referred to by the acronym ISFJ. Introverted,
            Sensing, Feeling, and Judging are its initials. ISFJs are described
            as being introverted, sensing, feeling, and sensing with a
            preference for planning and organisation over spontaneity and
            flexibility. They also tend to be more focused on facts and details
            than thoughts and concepts (Judging). Because of their need to
            ensure that others are secure and taken care of, ISFJs are
            occasionally referred to as Protector personalities.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ISFJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ISFJs are diligent in their behaviour and motivated by their own
            particular ideals. They often desire to put forth a lot of effort,
            get along with people, and fulfil their obligations.
            <br />
            Relationships are very important to ISFJs, and they work hard to maintain
            harmony and cooperation with others. They tend to maintain a strong sense
            of loyalty to their families and seek consistency and longevity in their
            relationships. People they know they can depend on in the long run are
            the ones with whom they feel the most connected.
            <br />
            ISFJs value tradition and like learning about how things used to be done.
            They want to follow the right, conventional course of action and are
            faithful to established practises and ideals. They place a high value
            on assimilating into established institutions and making a positive contribution
            to the upkeep of robust, stable social systems. They frequently play
            the historian in groups, ensuring that new members respect and honour
            the old traditions.

        <div class="mt-4">
            ISFJs are often modest and meek, and they don't like to draw
            attention to themselves. They are frequently observed quietly
            helping people in a modest manner. They are dependable and diligent,
            and they frequently dedicate themselves to jobs and endeavours with
            the intention of assisting their family, friends, and communities.
            Although they frequently participate in social groups, they like to
            stay out of the limelight and prefer to be found quietly performing
            their duties.
            <br />
            ISFJs are relationship-oriented, but they might be guarded around strangers.
            Rarely do they rapidly reveal personal information. They frequently provide
            specifics from their own personal experience while remaining attentive
            and aware of their surroundings. They frequently talk about their personal
            experiences and things they have firsthand knowledge about. They listen
            with empathy and frequently retain specifics about people. When establishing
            a connection, they frequently find it interesting to learn things about
            others.
