        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ESFP Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFPs are outgoing performers who captivate and enthral others
            around them. They enjoy the people, food, clothing, environment,
            animals, and especially people around them. They are impulsive,
            vivacious, and fun-loving.
            <br />
            ESFPs often have a contagious zest for life and are friendly and outgoing.
            They prefer to be at the centre of things and the focus of attention.
            They enjoy bringing other people out and making them laugh. They have
            a fun, open sense of humour.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ESFP stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is referred to by the acronym ESFP. Extraverted,
            Sensing, Feeling, and Perceiving are its initials. The personality
            type ESFP describes someone who gets their energy from being around
            other people, who prioritises facts and details above ideas and
            concepts, who bases decisions on feelings and principles, and who
            prefers to be flexible and impromptu rather than planned and
            organised (Perceiving). Because of their fun, vivacious
            dispositions, ESFPs are also referred to as Performer personalities.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ESFP Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFPs enjoy the present moment and all that life has to offer. They
            have great sensory awareness and enjoy the sights, sounds, smells,
            and sensations around them. ESFPs enjoy being active, so they cram
            their schedules with interests, sports, social engagements, and
            friends. When there are too many fascinating things to do, they may
            get overwhelmed since they prefer to live impulsively rather than
            plan ahead. Nothing is worse to an ESFP than being left out of the
            fun.
            <br />
            ESFPs tend to be fun-loving, but they are also often realistic and down
            to earth. They have a firm grasp on reality and are frequently acutely
            aware of the specifics of their surroundings, particularly as they relate
            to people. They are perceptive to other people's needs and are quick
            to offer assistance. ESFPs like to lend a hand, especially in real, concrete
            ways.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ESFP</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESFPs are frequently the light of the party, joking around and
            energising others. They pay attention to whether others are having
            fun and try to make things enjoyable for everyone. ESFPs may take
            the initiative to engage everyone in an active diversion because
            they are most comfortable in their physical surroundings. Although
            they tend to be very open and pleasant, ESFPs might be difficult to
            become close to because they find it difficult to be serious or talk
            about anything negative.
            <br />
            Due to their keen sense of smell and touch, ESFPs are drawn to situations
            with attractive hues and textures. They frequently chose their surroundings'
            materials and ornaments with great care. The attention they receive frequently
            manifests in other ways as well; ESFPs frequently dress in sensual fabrics
            or vibrant, eye-catching hues. They frequently follow the most recent
            trends and enjoy introducing others to novel settings and experiences.
