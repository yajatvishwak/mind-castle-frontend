        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ESTP Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ESTPs are enthusiastic thrill-seekers who perform best when
            extinguishing fires, whether they be real or imagined. They interact
            with people and the world around them with a sense of dynamic
            vitality. They make fast assessments of the environment and react
            skillfully to respond to urgent issues with workable solutions.
            <br />
            ESTPs are often the light of the party and have a strong sense of humour.
            They are fun and active. They assess their audience using their acute
            observational skills and change direction rapidly to keep encounters
            engaging. The ESTP loves to keep things fast-paced and humorous rather
            than emotional or serious, despite the fact that they frequently give
            off the impression of being very social.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ESTP stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is known by the initials ESTP. Extraverted,
            Sensing, Thinking, and Perceiving are its initials. The personality
            type ESTP is characterised by extraversion (being energised by other
            people), sensing (focusing on facts and details rather than ideas
            and concepts), thinking (making decisions based on logic and
            reason), and preference for spontaneity and flexibility over planned
            and organised behaviour (Perceiving). Because of their high-energy,
            active way of life, ESTPs are also known as "dynamo personalities."
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ESTP Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Natural athletes, ESTPs can move around their physical environment
            with ease and have a good sense of coordination. They frequently
            love putting their skills to the test in risky or even dangerous
            activities, and they enjoy using this physical aptitude in the
            search of thrill and adventure.
            <br />
            The moment-to-moment focus of the ESTP is action. They interact with
            their surroundings and find quick solutions to difficulties of a practical
            nature. ESTPs succeed in urgent situations when they can use their logical
            thinking to determine the best course of action. The ESTP loves to see
            immediate, observable results, therefore long-term goals are less intriguing
            to them.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ESTP</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            The ESTP's energy is probably what you notice about them right away.
            They frequently converse, joke around, and flirt with both friends
            and total strangers. They enjoy having lively interactions with
            others and making everyone around them laugh with their silly
            humour. People are frequently kept on their toes since they never
            know what the ESTP will make fun of next. ESTPs are openly sociable
            with others, but their interest in people may wane over time. They
            are more likely to work a room and have a good time with everyone
            than they are to have a meaningful conversation with any one person.
            <br />
            ESTPs feel at ease in their surroundings and are constantly looking for
            something to do. They are the most naturally coordinated of all the types
            and are frequently seen participating in sports or other physical activities,
            particularly ones that include some level of danger. They fit the stereotype
            of "adrenaline junkies" and can be seen participating in extreme sports
            like skydiving or racing motorcycles.
