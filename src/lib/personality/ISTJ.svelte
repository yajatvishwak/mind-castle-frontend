        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ISTJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ISTJs are responsible planners who are compelled to establish and
            uphold order within institutions and processes. They prefer to
            follow a set of rules for everything they do and are clean and
            organised both inside and out. ISTJs are dependable and obedient
            people who value tradition and adhere to rules.
            <br />
            ISTJs consistently and effectively contribute. Even though they are introverted,
            ISTJs are rarely alone; they are curious about how they might contribute
            to established organisations and systems and are aware of their place
            in the world. They are concerned with preserving the social structure
            and ensuring that expectations are realised.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ISTJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types developed by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is referred to by the acronym ISTJ. Introverted,
            Sensing, Thinking, and Judging are its initials. The personality
            type ISTJ describes someone who gets their energy from alone time
            (Introverted), who prefers facts and details to thoughts and notions
            (Sensing), who bases their decisions on logic and reason (Thinking),
            and who prefers to be ordered and planned rather than spontaneous
            and flexible (Judging). Because of their attention to detail and
            desire to carry out tasks precisely, ISTJs are frequently referred
            to as Inspector personalities.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ISTJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ISTJs value predictability over creativity and like to know the
            rules of the game. They prefer to be in familiar settings and rely
            on their past experiences for guidance. ISTJs respect the value of
            consistent practise to hone their talents and trust the
            tried-and-true approach.
            <br />
            ISTJs are persistent and work diligently until a task is completed. They
            are meticulous and analytical people who frequently take pleasure in
            jobs that call for them to employ deductive reasoning to come up with
            solutions. They pay special attention to the little things and scrutinise
            everything to ensure accuracy. ISTJs labour methodically to bring order
            to their own little corners of the world with their clear logic and attention
            to detail.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ISTJ</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            The ISTJ personality type exudes a sober, traditional aura. They
            often seek for predictable environments where they are aware of
            their function because they want to know the rules of the game and
            play by them. The ISTJ may be helpful even in social situations
            (like as arranging jackets and hats at a reception) because they
            often feel more at ease managing a task than they do mingling with
            strangers. When assigned a task, they are very dependable and
            complete it successfully.
            <br />
            ISTJs rarely draw attention to themselves and are pragmatic and no-nonsense.
            They have a fondness for the classics and choose their outfits and possessions
            more for practicality than for fashion. ISTJs are known for their clear
            speech and keen attention to detail. They typically show greater enthusiasm
            while imparting factual information than when delving into ethereal thoughts
            or untested theories.
