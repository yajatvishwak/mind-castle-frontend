        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ENFJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Idealistic planners, ENFJs are determined to carry out their vision
            of what is best for humanity. Because of their capacity for
            recognising potential in others and their charismatic ability to
            influence others, they frequently serve as catalysts for human
            growth. They are fervent about the possibilities for people and are
            values- and vision-driven.
            <br />
            ENFJs frequently have a lot on their plates and tend to be enthusiastic
            and driven people. They have a keen awareness of others' needs and are
            sensitive to human suffering, but they also have a tendency to be upbeat
            and forward-looking, instinctively sensing opportunities for progress.
            While the ENFJ is ambitious, it is not self-serving; rather, they feel
            personally accountable for improving the world.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ENFJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types developed by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is referred to by the acronym ENFJ. Extraverted,
            iNtuitive, Feeling, and Judging are its initials. Extroverted,
            iNtuitive, feeling, and extraverted are all characteristics of the
            ENFJ personality type. They focus on ideas and concepts rather than
            facts and details, make decisions based on their values and
            feelings, and prefer to be organised and planned rather than
            spontaneous and flexible. Because of their desire to foster the
            growth and development of others, ENFJs are sometimes referred to as
            teacher personalities.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ENFJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            ENFJs are motivated by a strong sense of empathy and altruism. They
            frequently serve as an emotional barometer for others around them
            since they have an intuitive awareness of others' emotions. Their
            compassion, however, is not limited to those close to them; they
            frequently have a humanitarian outlook and may genuinely care about
            the woes of the entire human race. They often feel other people's
            emotions firsthand and are moved to action when they witness
            suffering.
            <br />
            ENFJs value intimate relationships and mutual support and think that
            working together is the best approach to accomplish goals. They seek
            approval and are extremely sensitive to both positive and negative criticism.
            The ENFJ may be frustrated when others are not as sincere in their goals
            as they are since they want the best not only from themselves but also
            from others. ENFJs put up a lot of effort to keep their bonds strong
            and to contribute positively to their families, groups, and communities.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ENFJ</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Natural educators, ENFJs are frequently seen getting others to
            participate in educational activities. They have a propensity to
            assume control and direct a group of people toward the experiences
            and activities that will best serve their learning and development.
            They have a keen sense of human potential, and they inspire others
            to develop their strengths further by being warm and charismatic.
            They are usually active and busy, and they frequently exhibit
            visible vigour when inspiring others to learn new things.
            <br />
            ENFJs are often good communicators with a gift for connecting with others
            through language. They have a keen sense of interpersonal interactions
            and like discussing them. They frequently take pleasure in assisting
            others in resolving personal issues and love imparting their knowledge
            of people, their emotions, and their motivations. They can become worn
            out if there is too much negative emotion around because they can be
            overly sympathetic at times.
