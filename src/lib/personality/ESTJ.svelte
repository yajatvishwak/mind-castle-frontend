        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The ESTJ Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Hardworking traditionalists, ESTJs are eager to take the reins when
            it comes to managing tasks and people. Orderly, law-abiding, and
            diligent, ESTJs like to get things done and frequently approach
            tasks in a logical, systematic fashion.
            <br />
            ESTJs are master planners who aspire to give their surroundings order.
            They appreciate regularity and favour logical progression. The ESTJ frequently
            takes the initiative to create procedures and rules when they notice
            a lack of organisation so that everyone is aware of what is expected.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does ESTJ stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            One of the sixteen personality types identified by Isabel Myers and
            Katharine Briggs is known by the initials ESTJ. Extraverted,
            Sensing, Thinking, and Judging are its initials. The personality
            type ESTJ describes someone who gets their energy from being around
            other people (extroverted), who concentrates on facts and details
            instead of ideas and concepts (sensing), who makes decisions using
            logic and reason (thinking), and who prefers to be organised and
            planned rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). Because of
            their propensity to assume leadership roles and ensure that tasks
            are completed precisely, ESTJs are occasionally referred to as
            Supervisor personalities.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">ESTJ Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Conventional, factual, and rooted in reality are all traits of
            ESTJs. The history provides the ESTJ with evidence of what has been
            successful in the past. They trust their own expertise and prefer
            facts to speculation. The ESTJ seeks out guidelines and norms to
            uphold, and they frequently take the initiative to assist others in
            doing the same. They are concerned with upholding social order and
            controlling others.
            <br />
            At home and at work, ESTJs frequently take on the job of project manager
            because they are excellent goal-setters, decision-makers, and resource
            managers. The ESTJ wants to be productively efficient and typically thinks
            that this can be done best when individuals and processes are well-organized.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the ESTJ</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            When an ESTJ is in charge of a situation, it's because they have a
            clear understanding of what should happen and are prepared to take
            charge to make it happen. They prioritise their tasks and prioritise
            work over play. The ESTJ looks to be in charge almost usually
            because they are tough-minded and self-assured. ESTJs value order
            and frequently start organising as soon as they walk into a place.
            They want to lay out the ground rules and make sure that everyone
            follows them.
            <br />
            In organisations like clubs, associations, societies, and churches, ESTJs
            frequently participate and often assume leadership positions. Sharing
            rituals and routines is how they usually establish connections with others.
            For ESTJs, social engagement frequently entails adhering to established
            customs in order to interact with people in a planned manner. ESTJs frequently
            seek out and respect hierarchy. If there are no levels of responsibility,
            they will assign them because they want to know who is in charge. Once
            a system is established, ESTJs often respect and obey those in positions
            of authority.
