        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">The INFP Personality Type</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            The underlying ideals and beliefs of INFPs serve as their compass.
            They are inventive idealists. A Healer is more concerned with
            potential than with the reality of the present. They see hope for a
            brighter future and, with their own distinctive flair, seek out
            truth and significance.
            <br />
            Intuitive, empathetic, and sympathetic, INFPs are passionate about both
            their own and other people's personal development. Individualistic and
            compassionate, INFPs think that everyone should follow their own path.
            They take pleasure in spending time examining their own beliefs and ideals
            and gently nudge others to do the same. INFPs are imaginative and frequently
            artistic; they take pleasure in discovering new ways to express themselves.
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">What does INFP stand for?</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTIÂ®), which was developed by
            Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs, includes sixteen different
            personality types. INFP is one of them. The acronym INFP, which
            stands for Introversion, iNtuition, Feeling, and Perceiving, refers
            to four fundamental personality traits based on the research of
            psychologist C.G. Jung.
            <br />
            Each of the four letters that make up the INFP code stands for a crucial
            aspect of this personality type. Introverted, iNtuitive, feeling-based,
            and focusing on ideas and concepts rather than facts and specifics are
            all characteristics of INFPs. They also tend to be spontaneous and flexible
            rather than planned and organised (Perceiving).
            <br />
            Because of their gentle compassion and sympathetic idealism, the INFP
            personality type is also known as the "Healer." The INFP also goes by
            the names:
            <ul>
                <li>The Thoughtful Idealist (MBTI)</li>
                <li>The Mediator (16Personalities)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">INFP Values and Motivations</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            INFPs value originality and want to be themselves in all they do.
            They frequently focus on their own internal quest for meaning and
            truth. For INFPs, tradition has little appeal; they would rather
            explore their own values and ideas and make their own judgments
            about what appears right. Although INFPs are frequently eccentric
            and unique, they have no urge to fit in. The INFP would rather be
            loyal to who they are than strive to blend in.
            <br />
            In their interactions with others, INFPs are welcoming and nonjudgmental
            since they think that everyone should choose their own path. They are
            adaptable and tolerant and frequently have a wide range of perspectives.
            Supporting others is vital to the INFP, but if they feel their own values
            are being compromised, they may react strongly. They particularly detest
            being bullied by those who claim there is just one correct course of
            action. INFPs desire frank and encouraging discussion of ideas.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-lg opacity-50">How Others See the INFP</h1>
        <div class="mt-4">
            Because they keep their most genuine thoughts and feelings for those
            they know well, INFPs may appear chilly at first. They frequently
            cherish significant dialogues about morals, ethics, people, and
            personal development because they are contemplative and frequently
            spiritual. The Healer is constantly seeking a deeper comprehension
            of both oneself and the people around them. They are typically
            inquisitive and open-minded. Few people are aware of how deeply
            committed the INFP is to their principles; they are enthusiastic
            about them but also reserved.
            <br />
            INFPs are sensitive and empathic people who actively pursue meaning and
            authenticity throughout their lives. This type is less interested in
            the commonplace things of life and gets more aroused by intriguing concepts
            than useful information. They normally don't question other people and
            may be very curious about unusual viewpoints or unconventional lifestyles.
            They frequently have a specific fondness for the arts, particularly the
            avant-garde, as they like discovering novel ideas for self-expression.
